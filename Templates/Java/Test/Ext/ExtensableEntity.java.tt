/**
 * I am created by hand
 *
 * I extend the generated class BaseDrive, and provide any additional functionality, which should be minimal since
 * I'm a simple data object
 *
 * I don't get an interface because java does not support properties, which would force the following:
 * <code>
 * {
 * ...
 *     @SerializedName("DriveType")
 *     public String driveType;
 *     public String getDriveType() { return driveType; }
 *     public void setDriveType(final String newDriveType) { driveType = newDriveType; }
 * }
 * At first this doesn't seem bad, until you realize that driveType has to be made public so that Gson can write
 * that value, meaning that users will easily get confused
 *
 * </code>
